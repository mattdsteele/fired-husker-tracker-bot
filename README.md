I don't really know what I'm doing with this Go thing.

## Things I wish I knew

- Tooling - VS Code? Only get compiler errors when I save. No autocomplete on anything
- Module format - how to handle multiple entry points (Twitter v Mastodon v standalone)
- File structure more generally esp w/ 1.11 modules
- Testing - mock dependencies, assertion libs, etc. What's good examples of this?
- Windoze - `go build` errors out, I have to specify every file :(
